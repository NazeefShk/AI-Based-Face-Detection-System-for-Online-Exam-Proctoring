# AI-Based Face Detection System for Online Exam Proctoring

## Overview
This project is a real-time AI-based face detection system designed to monitor candidates during online examinations using a webcam. The system helps detect suspicious activities such as absence of a face or the presence of multiple faces, supporting integrity in remote assessments.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Continuous monitoring of candidate presence
- Detection of multiple faces to identify suspicious behavior
- Lightweight and easy to run locally

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Computer Vision
- YOLOv3 (for detection)

## How It Works
The system captures live video from a webcam and processes each frame using computer vision techniques.  
Face detection is applied in real time to:
- Check if a face is present
- Detect multiple faces in the frame

Based on these checks, the system can flag potential suspicious activity during an online examination.

## Model Weights
This project uses **YOLOv3** for detection.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the `yolov3.weights` file is **not included** in this repository.

### Download the weights from:
https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

After downloading, place the file in the project root directory.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-exam-proctoring-system.git
cd ai-exam-proctoring-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python proctoring.py
Make sure your webcam is connected before running the program.
